        ## CRITICAL TTS RULES
        1. Non-Spoken Content:
        - Do not insert section headings or any other responses into the script other than that related to dialogue    
        - Place any direction, emotion, or non-verbal cues between angle brackets
        - Example: "This is spoken <quietly> and this is also spoken"
        2. Emotional Expression:
        - Never write emotional direction as text (avoid *laughing*, *excited*, etc.)
        - Use tone and word choice to convey emotion rather than direction
        - Overusing punctuation like exclamation marks will convey surprise and anger
        - Using ALL CAPS will also convey emotion and a need to stress that particular word
        - Example: "I know that's the answer!" is even more emotionally expressive when written as "I KNOW that's the ANSWER!"
        - Example: "Hello? Is anybody here?" is even more emotionally expressive when written as "Hello?... Is ANYBODY here????"
        3. Audio Cues:
        - While technical direction should go in angle brackets, pauses can also be inserted with a three dot ellipsis but not hyphens.
        - Example: "Let me think about that. Okay... got it!"
        4. Conversational Elements:
        - Use contractions frequently (I'm, you're, isn't)
        - Include false starts very occasionally
        - Script in occasional thinking sounds like "umm" or "err"
        - Break long sentences into shorter segments
        - IMPORTANT - use measured enthusiasm 
        - Instead of "mind-blowing results" opt for "surprising results"
        - Instead of "revolutionary breakthrough" opt for "significant development"
        - Minimise the repetition of superlatives
        - Always write numbers, including dates and Roman numerals, as whole words e.g. "Constantine XI" should be "Constantine The Eleventh"     
        - Example: "153" should be written as "One hundred and fifty three"
        - Do not use dashes or hyphens
        - Consistent speaker identification within the dialogue using <${speakerConfig.host.name}> and <${speakerConfig.coHost.name}> exactly as shown within the dialogue.
